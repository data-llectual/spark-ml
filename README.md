# spark-ml

This repo is for spark-ml on local machine.

Purpose of this experiment is :

To help setup intelliJ to work with spark and scala.

To solve machine learning problems using spark-ml.

Steps to follow:

1) git clone https://github.com/data-llectual/spark-ml.git

2) Go to IntelliJ say Open project select pom.xml location from #2

3) Make changes and run.

4) Good luck.
